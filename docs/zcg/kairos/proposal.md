# Zcash Matching Fund

## Pitch

Zcash would benefit from a donation-based, small grants _matching_ fund that
is:

- Efficient
- Fair
- Scalable/Granular - scales up and down based on enthusiasm and commitment
- Community-driven
- Awards based on sentiment and conviction
- Promotes collaboration and positive competition
- Programmatic, deterministic, rules-based
- Measurable
- Notable, marketable
- A showcase of Zcash's properties, unique features, (VK, memo, multisig, ...)

### Team

Open Kairos Foundation. 2Z Team, Skylar, Jonathan. Rosalba, Eduardo, KSU
statistics, FPF, Shielded Labs, ZecHub, ZURE, ... ZF, ... (?).

<!--
TODO: Finalize Open Kairos Foundation and team.

Please reach out if you would like to be part of the final draft!

The Zcash Matching Fund (ZMF for short) will be the first initiative of the Open Kairos Foundation.  Open Kairos is a new non-profit with a broad mission
to further public good, education, and charity by supporting open source software and other technologies that are leading to a better future for humanity.

The initial board of directors has not yet been finalized.
Please get in though now if you would like to be involved.
Joining the Open Kairos Foundation team will exclude you and
people close to you from receiving matching funds.
-->

<!-- TODO: finalize other entities to be part of the team.

In addition to the Open Kairos team, we hope to add other entities to the
multisig custody of the fund.

The idea is that a multisig with several non-profits will help ensure the
validity of the operation. But, entities that take part in the calculation
and distribution should not be recipients of the funds. To simplify fiscal considerations we would only consider other 501(c)(3) nonprofits or similar.

Ideally, the matching fund would be a showcase of Zcash's desirable security
properties including offline signing, multisig, and best practices.
Perhaps a 2 of 3 would be efficient operationally and secure.

Considering activities that are outside of the core competencies of
the Open Kairos team, specifically in marketing, legal, and security,
we should reach out to other entities to be part of the team.

EFF/Naomi/CoinCenter/Least Authority/... (?)

Let's reach out and see who might want to be part of the grant.

### Total request (ZEC or USD)

<!--
The overhead stated here is basically for an MVP with a small team.

If more people or entities want to join the grant, we could add more budget.
 -->

1500 ZEC to implement the MVP software and processes and be ready for Q1 2025.
500 ZEC per year to operate. Total overhead: 1 year 2000 ZEC. 2 years 2500 ZEC.

Up to 4000 ZEC per year matching (1000 ZEC per quarter).

Total for 1 year: 2000 to implement and operate + up to 4000 in matching fund

2,000-6,000 ZEC total (depending on independent donor participation)

Total for 2 years: 2500 to implement and operate + up to 8,000 ZEC in matching

2,500-10,500 ZEC total (depending on independent donor participation)

### Applicant Background

New non-profit Open Kairos Foundation, Free2Z, KSU stats, ... (?) ...
collaboration! We should see if FPF or other entities want to sign on and help.
The implementation, operation, administration, marketing, legal, compliance are
going to take significant effort, some of which could be parallelized and
worked on independently.

<!--
2000 ZEC is quite thrifty to implement and operate the program for 1 year
at current ZEC prices - but probably doable.

If more people want to join the team, we should maybe ask for more.
We could have a better MVP, more marketing, more outreach, more time put into
compliance, more work put into the Zcash-specific parts of the program.
Security audit? Taylor? Least Authority? FPF? ZF? Shielded Labs? ZecHub?

Being part of the grant team will exclude from the matching fund.

### Description of Problem or Opportunity
Zcash could benefit from a community based, small grants _matching_ fund that showcases the best of Zcash's properties and unique features.  The fund should be efficient, fair, scalable, programmatic, measurable and notable.

Many people are doing work in the Zcash ecosystem and adjacent to it that
Zcashers may want to fund. Many initiatives are out-of-scope for ZCG, ZF,
ZecHub and other funding mechanisms.

<!-- People and projects who are near Zcash but would not be funded by ZCG or ZF. -->

- Traditional non-profits and charities
- Education and research
- Public goods, open source software, and infrastructure
- Community building, events, and meetups
- Art, media, and culture
- Individual contributors, content creators, and influencers
- Hackers, tinkerers, and hobbyists
- Students, interns, and volunteers
- Journalists, writers, and researchers
- Teachers, professors, and educators
- Podcasters and streamers
- People who are not yet in the Zcash ecosystem
- People who are not yet in the cryptocurrency ecosystem

Fairly and efficiently distributing the block reward for community projects is
a challenge.

ZCG is best suited for larger grants to contributors to the protocol and core
usability of Zcash. The five member committee is not optimised for many small
grants. ZCG is focused on public goods funding and to some extent education but
not charity and not small individual grants.

ZecHub is doing amazing work with individuals and teams in the Zcash ecosystem
using task-based funding for Zcash-related projects, primarily focused on
education.

Free2Z has complemented these other organizations by offering an additional free-form mechanism to get funded for producing Zcash content. Free2Z offers an easy way to fly a Zcash address publicly and ask for real private, p2p donations or direct grants of ZEC. This has been particularly useful for the Zcash Community in the global south.

The ZMF matching funding mechanism will be an additional way to receive
funds that will be more structured, predictable, and scalable - with
separate APIs and UIs for donors and recipients.

The proposed fund will augment and complement the existing mechanisms. One of
the biggest differentiators is that it is a _matching_ fund. This means that
the community can donate to projects through the fund and the fund will match
those donations based on a formula. This is a way to distribute the block
reward programmatically and fairly based on community sentiment and conviction.
The magnitude of the mechanism in any given quarter will thus be flexible based
on the community's enthusiasm and commitment.

Potential recipients can opt in to the matching fund program and describe their
work, idea, or cause. Donors can browse the list of potential recipients and
donate to them through the matching fund. The fund will match those donations
based on a formula.

Hopefully a nice mix of Zcash-aligned organizations and individuals will apply
for matching and the community will donate to them through the fund. Many may
register for just "doing their thing". Hopefully traditional non-profits like
the EFF and CoinCenter will register (if they choose not to join the team).
Hopefully popular podcasters, writers and creatives in the space will register
for "doing their thing". Grants will not be task-based or milestone-based.
Community projects across the world can and should register. All they really
need is an idea that promotes either a public good, education, or charity, a
willingness to accept ZEC, and recognition that they will have to put up with
the minimal mandatory compliance to receive funds.

Individual Zcashers will need to donate to unlock the matching funds for the
recipients. Participation is key to success: both in applying for matching and
in donating to the fund. People will have to put their ZEC where their mouth is; the 1000 ZEC matching per quarter will only be paid
out if the community donates at least 1000 ZEC through the fund.

## **Proposed Solution**

### The Fund Wallet

A wallet is created with a unified address. This wallet is controlled by a
non-profit or threshold signature of non-profits and DAOs with best practice
security standards.

It is empty to start.

### People opt in to the matching fund program

- Affirm Public Good, Educational, or Charity.
- Affirm they will undergo any minimal AML and other compliance requirements to
  receive funds (as applicable, work with experts to minimize burden and
  maximize accessibility).
- Get an identifier (for use in the VK and matching calculation)
- Describe the idea, create content, link people to their work

The scope of the grant recipients can be quite wide. Hopefully everyone in the
privacy space will register to get some funds to "do their thing" that they are
already doing. We will reach out personally and through ZCG, ZF, ZecHub, and
other channels to get people whom the community loves to register.

### Matching fund menu / leaderboard

The ZMF will leverage Free2Z as the platform of choice for its matching program.  This will require significant enhancements to Free2Z's open source UI and backend.
Potential donors and lurkers will be able to see everyone who has opted in to the matching
program, browse the potential recipients, and decide to donate easily. The
donations will be made with shielded transactions with memos. A VK will be published so
everyone can see the donations and even make their own UI. The UI and new
backend code will be MIT open source so anyone outside of Free2Z can make and
interface to the VK data. A realtime leaderboard will be published on Free2Z. The
matching fund status will be displayed on the Free2z UI and people will be able to donate
shielded ZEC to the fund and see their donation come up on the leaderboard and
with the VK.

Simple format for the matching donations so people can also add a message (?)

<!--
Matching grant idea: ZecHub or other entities who are not part of "the team"
could make UIs to the VK data and the matching fund data and verify/review the
calculations and scripting for disbursement.
 -->

Donations are made throughout the quarter.
At the end of the quarter, the matching fund will calculate the disbursement
based on the votes and the donations. The disbursement will be made to the
recipients with a process defined by the end of Q1 2025.

### Solution Format

Extensions to Free2Z to:

- accommodate voting and donating for quadratic matching
- UI for opting in to the matching fund program
- UI for browsing the potential recipients
- UI for donating to recipients through the matching fund

Scripts, runbooks for:

- Creating secure wallet
- Running zebrad, lightwalletd, VK -> database automation
- Calculating the matching fund disbursement
- Payouts to recipients

Marketing, outreach, community building, and engagement:

- Invite many Zcash-aligned organizations and individuals formally and
  personally
- Blog posts, videos, recorded meetings, Free2Z Live
- Community calls at least every quarter
- Public retrospectives
- Follow up with recipients
- Iterative adjustments to the program
- Documentation and code open source
<!-- - Academic statistician to help with the methodology and to publish the results -->

Legal and compliance:

- Minimal mandatory compliance for recipients (eg AML)
  - Documentation and disclosure
  - Work with experts to minimize burden and maximize accessibility
- Best practice security for the fund wallet
- Matching Funds are held by a non-profit or threshold signature of non-profits
- Automation of any tax documents required for recipients

### Technical Approach

zebrad, lightwalletd, warp, FROST for the funds. Calculation will be done in
Python and the data will be published, likely with jupyter notebooks. Donor and
recipient interfaces will be added to Free2Z - React and Django.

The Free2Z UI is open source and new backend implementations for this grant
will be added to the ZUU repository with an MIT license.

### Dependencies

Would rather do multisig with several non-profits that can help ensure the
validity of the operation. Need support from experts in the space with zebrad,
lightwalletd, wallet scripting, FROST. Consultation with technical experts.

<!--
TODO: reach out and see who might want to be part of the grant.

I could do basically all of the work. But, Jan1 is coming up fast and some
of the work could be parallelized and shared.

- Backend modeling for APIs (python/django)
  - Voting eligibility (flexible for sybil resistance versus accessibility)
  - Opt-in to matching fund program
  - Leaderboard, search
- UI features (React)
  - Join matching fund program easy stepper workflow
  - Easy donation UI - select recipient and send donation to fund with zip321
  - Hot leaderboard, link to other materials through profiles
- Zcash-specific: zebrad, lightwalletd, VK, memo, multisig, FROST

-->

Free2Z needs to stay healthy since the program will be run there. Security,
scalability, and best practices must be continually invested in. Hopefully
straightforward, programmable FROST will emerge by April. It should be possible
now but there are only a few people who can do it. Hopefully they will either
help us directly or make it easy for us to do it.

### Execution Risks

Security must be best practice because non-trivial value will be at stake. It
should be a showcase of Zcash's desirable security properties but any mistake
could be a major embarrassment.

### Unintended Consequences

We hope that it brings different parts of the community together because it is
rules-based and helps to distribute the block reward programmatically. But, ZCG
funds that go to this initiative will necessarily not go to other initiatives.
So, if this initiative isn't aligned and nourishing the entire ecosystem, it
would be a shame.

### Evaluation Plan

We will have community calls at least every quarter but probably more like once
a month or once every few weeks to share and discuss the data as it comes. For
the final calculation, we will likely use a variety of constant values and run
several calculations to choose from based on the data. We will publish the
methodology and the data with the chosen constants. People can independently
verify the calculations and suggest improvements. Each quarter we will do a
public retrospective and talk about iterative adjustments to the program. We
will follow up with recipients to see how the program turned out for them.

<!-- TODO: find a stats program/professor that wants to come along and help us.

Ideally we find an academic statistician to help us with the methodology and
to publish the results.

Does someone want to come in for free? Would we need to add budget for this?

Seems like a good project for a statistics student or professor to get involved.
-->
The hypothesis is that we can make huge impact very efficiently.
