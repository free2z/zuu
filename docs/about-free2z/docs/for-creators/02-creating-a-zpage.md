All you need to create a zPage is a title and some content.
You should also upload a featured image for your zPage.

The "content" field on a zPage allows creators to share a wide range of content with their audience using free2z-flavored markdown. This includes the ability to embed content from over 2100 sources using the ::embed[URL] syntax, making it easy to add videos, audio, images, and more to your zPage. In addition to embeds, free2z-flavored markdown also supports LaTeX math, code blocks, and other advanced formatting options, allowing creators to create rich and engaging pages for their audience. This flexibility and versatility in the content field enables creators to share their work in a variety of formats and styles, and to create unique and engaging pages that showcase their talents and ideas.
