## Monetization

### Zcash Donations

One of the key features of Free2Z for creators is the ability to receive direct, peer-to-peer donations from their fans and supporters using
[Zcash](https://z.cash). This means that creators can raise funds for their work without having to pay any fees or commissions, and can maintain a high level of privacy and security.

### 2Z Revenue Sharing

In addition to Zcash donations, creators can also accumulate [2Z credits](/revenue-sharing), which can currently be used inside the app to boost their content, donate to and subscribe to other creators, and access other services. Once you have accumulated 2Z credits, you can also apply to become a [Free2Z Partner](/revenue-sharing) and receive $0.01 per 2Z you earn.
