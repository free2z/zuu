## Access Control

Your files can be set to one of three access levels: "public," "private," or "members-only." Public files are accessible to anyone, private files are only accessible to you, and members-only files are accessible to subscribers of the creator of the files. This simple access control feature allows you to easily share your files with the appropriate audience and offer exclusive content to your subscribed fans.

### How Private is Private?

When you set a file to "private" access, it is only accessible to you, the owner of the file. However, it is important to note that Free2Z administrators and the cloud storage provider may have access to your files. Additionally, your files are not currently end-to-end encrypted and may be subject to censorship or legal action. Don't upload anything bad.

## Storage Options

The well-architected Free2Z storage system can be used as a content delivery network (CDN), a private file store, or as a feature to reward your subscribed fans. You get one gigabyte of storage for free, and each additional gigabyte can be purchased for 10 2Zs (in-app currency).
