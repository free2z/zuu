# Peer-to-Peer Donations with Zcash üõ°Ô∏èüí∞

Free2Z champions creator empowerment and user privacy. Integrating Zcash for peer-to-peer donations is our way of ensuring you can support creators on our platform while your personal data stays off the radar.

## Why Zcash? ü§î

In the crypto world, privacy can be a rare commodity. Bitcoin and Ethereum, for instance, leave a public trail. Zcash breaks the mold with its fully encrypted transactions, mirroring the discretion of cash in a digital avatar.

:::tip üõ°Ô∏è Privacy Matters
Zcash offers unmatched privacy benefits for both supporters and creators. As a supporter, you can make donations anonymously, with your identity hidden even from the recipient. This ensures your generosity remains private, seen by no one unless you decide otherwise. For creators, Zcash provides the assurance of receiving support without disclosing financial transactions to the public. This encryption-based system mirrors the discretion of cash transactions in a digital format, offering a secure and private way to give and receive support.

## How it Works ‚öôÔ∏è

### For Creators:

### For Supporters:
- **Support in Stealth Mode**: Spot a creator you fancy? Use their Zcash address to send support directly from your wallet to theirs, no Free2Z login needed, no personal information revealed, no
one can see your transactions. Reveal only what you want to reveal.

### Transaction Completion:
- **Direct, Discreet, Done**: The donation hits the creator's Zcash address directly, maintaining privacy for both sides.
