Free2Z offers the ability for supporters to make direct, peer-to-peer donations to creators using Zcash. This means that supporters can easily and securely support the creators they love, without having to pay any fees or commissions.

To make a donation using Zcash, supporters can navigate to the creator's profile or zPage and click on the "Donate" button. This will bring up a modal with a Zcash tab, which shows the creator's Zcash address and provides a QR code, payment URI, and copy-paste function to easily input the address into their Zcash wallet. Once the address is entered, supporters can choose the amount of Zcash they want to donate, and then complete the transaction using their Zcash wallet.

One of the key benefits of using Zcash for donations is that the transaction is private and secure. Free2Z has no visibility into the transaction, as the information is encrypted and only visible to the sender and recipient. This means that supporters can make donations with complete privacy and anonymity, if desired.

In addition to making a donation, supporters can also send a private message to the creator using Zcash's encrypted memo field. This allows supporters to provide feedback, ask questions, or send other messages to the creator, without having to share their personal information or compromise their privacy.

It's important to note that Free2Z has no way to know who is sending what to whom, as the transaction is private between the sender and recipient. This means that supporters can make anonymous donations if they choose, and can include a private message to the creator using Zcash's encrypted memo field.

By donating with Zcash, supporters can support the creators they love in a secure and private way, and help them to achieve their goals. Whether you are a fan of art, music, education, or any other type of content, you can use Zcash to make a difference and show your support.
