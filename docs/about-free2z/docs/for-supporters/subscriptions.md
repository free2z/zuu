# Subscribing with 2Zs

As a supporter, you can use 2Zs to subscribe to creators and support their work on a recurring basis. Subscribing with 2Zs is easy and convenient, and allows you to show your support and help creators continue to create and share their work.

Your subscription will be active immediately, and the creator will receive your support
every 30 days.
That's all there is to it! With just a few simple steps, you can use 2Zs to subscribe to creators and support their work on Free2Z.

## Setting a maximum monthly subscription amount

You can show extra appreciation for a creator by setting a maximum monthly subscription amount.
This allows you to set a limit on how much you want to spend on a creator each month.
The creator can thus raise their price to this amount and you will remain subscribed.
