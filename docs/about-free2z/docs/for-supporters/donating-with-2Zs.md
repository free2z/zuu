- **Convenient and fast**: 2Zs allow for quick and easy donations, making it easy to support the creators you care about.

It's important to note that 2Zs are not a decentralized or peer-to-peer cryptocurrency like Zcash or Bitcoin. 2Zs are not money; they are not a currency like dollars or euros. 2Zs are internal credits in our database that can be used for various features on the Free2Z platform. While 2Zs offer convenient and fast transactions, they are not a cryptocurrency and they have no value outside of the internal Free2Z app ecosystem.
