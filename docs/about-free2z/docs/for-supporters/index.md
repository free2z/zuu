You can use 2Zs to donate to and subscribe to creators, and to access other services as they become available.

### Subscriptions with 2Zs

This makes it easy and safe for you to get started on Free2Z, as you don't need to provide extensive personal information and can maintain your anonymity if desired. As a supporter you can even make donations using Zcash without logging in to the app. The commitment to the DKYC principle means that supporters don't need to trust Free2Z to protect their personal information and provide a safe and secure platform for supporting creators. By design, Free2Z is safe and secure for everyone to use, and allows you control of your own data.
