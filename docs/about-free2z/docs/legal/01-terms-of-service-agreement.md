(ii) For residents of the European Union or the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom, or Switzerland who are acting as a Consumer, these Terms of Service and any disputes, claims, or causes of action arising out of or in connection with them will be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware and applicable United States law, provided that this choice of governing law will not deprive you of the protection afforded to you by provisions that cannot be derogated from by agreement by virtue of the laws applicable where you habitually reside. In such cases, disputes shall be resolved in the competent civil courts as determined by applicable law.

(iii) If you are a resident in any jurisdiction other than those named in (ii) in which the arbitration provision in the section (i)(a) above is found to be unenforceable, then any disputes, claims, or causes of action arising out of or in connection with these Terms of Service shall be brought and resolved by the state or federal courts in New Castle County, Delaware or, if required by applicable law, then by competent civil courts within your jurisdiction of residence. If the governing law provision in (i)(b) is found to be unenforceable, then the laws of your jurisdiction of residence shall govern.
