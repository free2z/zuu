- **Contractors in Financial Rewards Program**: Contractors and partners who are actively engaged in the Free2Z platform and participate in our Financial Rewards Program are subject to a detailed compliance process. This process is essential for ensuring adherence to regulatory requirements and platform standards, particularly in the distribution of financial rewards. The Financial Rewards Program is designed to remunerate our contractors and partners for their valuable contributions to the Free2Z ecosystem, offering monetary incentives as a token of appreciation for their efforts and achievements.
