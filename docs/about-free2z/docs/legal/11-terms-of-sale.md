## Introduction

Certain products, services, and content may from time to time be made available to you (“You”) by the Company or its affiliates on Free2Z.

Your purchases of Ancillary Products and Services and your use of Free2Z are also governed by Free2Z's Terms of Service (“Terms of Service”), into which these Terms of Sale are incorporated by reference. For the avoidance of doubt, the Disputes section of the Terms of Service, including its sub-sections for Indemnification, Disclaimers; No Warranties, Limitation of Liability, Applicable Law and Venue, and Claims, and Miscellaneous also apply to your purchases of Ancillary Products and Services and your use of those purchases on the Free2Z.

## Modification of these Terms of Sale
The Company may amend any of the terms of these Terms of Sale by posting the amended terms at any time. Please check these Terms of Sale periodically for those changes. Any modified terms will apply to any purchase or renewal of Subscription Services (as defined below) made after such changes are posted on Free2Z. Therefore, you should review these Terms of Sale prior to each purchase so you will understand the terms applicable to such transaction. If you do not agree to these Terms of Sale, do not make any purchases on the Free2Z.

4. Payment Methods and Terms

We accept payment through major credit cards, certain debit cards, cryptocurrencies, PayPal, and/or such other payment methods we may make available to you from time-to-time through the Free2Z (“Payment Methods”).

PLEASE NOTE: Our payment processing partners may request that you provide certain personal data (e.g., a valid government-issued ID, your legal name, address, and date of birth) for the purpose of making payment through their financial institutions and complying with applicable international, national, federal, state, and local laws and regulations. They may also communicate directly with you regarding any issues with a payment.

If a purchase has been declined online due to issues with your Payment Method, we may suspend or cancel your order automatically. You are responsible for resolving any problem we encounter in order to proceed with your purchase.

The Company may impose an additional transaction fee based on transactions associated with the Free2Z, including a transaction fee applied to purchases from third parties. Such transaction fee will be disclosed to you prior to your consummation of the relevant transaction.

Accordingly, except as detailed in these Terms of Sale, to the extent permitted by applicable law, cancellations are not permitted after a purchase, and we do not offer any refunds.
