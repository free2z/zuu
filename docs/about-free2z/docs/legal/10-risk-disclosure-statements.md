## Introduction

This document contains Risk Disclosure Statements for users of the Free2Z platform (the "Platform"). It aims to inform users about the inherent risks associated with cryptocurrency transactions and participation in the revenue share program. By using the Platform, users acknowledge and accept these risks.

## General Risk Statement

- The use of the Platform, including participation in the revenue share program and engaging in cryptocurrency transactions, involves significant risks. Users should understand these risks and consider them in relation to their personal circumstances before using the Platform.

## Cryptocurrency Transaction Risks

1. **Market Risk**: Cryptocurrency markets are extremely volatile. Users acknowledge that the value of cryptocurrencies can fluctuate dramatically within a short period.
2. **Regulatory Risk**: The legal status of cryptocurrencies can be subject to change and varies by jurisdiction. Users should be aware that regulatory changes, restrictions, or bans may impact the value or legality of their cryptocurrency activities, which are conducted independently and not facilitated by Free2Z.
3. **Technology Risk**: Cryptocurrencies operate on digital platforms. Users are exposed to risks including operational failures, cyberattacks, and loss of funds due to technical vulnerabilities.

## Revenue Share Program Risks

1. **Earnings Variability**: Free2Z does not guarantee any fixed earnings through the revenue share program. The amount a user may earn can vary based on several factors, including user engagement and changes in the Platform's policies or algorithms.
2. **Regulatory Compliance**: Contractors eligible for financial rewards through our rewards program are subject to AML/KYC compliance checks. These checks are a standard part of our due diligence for the rewards program, ensuring compliance with legal standards. They do not reflect typical activities associated with financial service operations, as Free2Z does not operate as a financial institution.
3. **Tax Liability**: Participation in the revenue share program may create tax liabilities for users. Users are responsible for understanding and complying with their tax obligations.

## No Liability

- Free2Z is not liable for any losses or damages incurred as a result of using the Platform, participating in the revenue share program, or engaging in cryptocurrency transactions. This includes, but is not limited to, losses or damages resulting from market volatility, regulatory changes, technological issues, or individual user actions.

## User Responsibility

- Users are solely responsible for their decisions and actions on the Platform. They are advised to seek independent financial, legal, or tax advice as appropriate.

## Amendments to Risk Disclosures

- The Company reserves the right to modify these Risk Disclosure Statements at any time. Continued use of the Platform after changes signifies acceptance of the new terms.

## Governing Law
