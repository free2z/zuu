title: Token Redemption Policy

## Introduction

This Token Redemption Policy (the "Policy") outlines the terms under which partners in the Free2Z platform (the "Platform") can redeem 2Z tokens ("2Zs") for a share of the revenue. This Policy is part of the broader Terms of Service of Free2Z.

## Discretionary Redemption

The allocation of financial rewards in exchange for 2Z tokens within the Free2Z platform **is a discretionary process conducted by Free2Z**. This process is exclusive to our contractors and does not imply a general right or guarantee of conversion for all platform users. The decision to allocate rewards in exchange for 2Z tokens is made solely by the Company, based on internal criteria.

## Redemption Eligibility and Process

- Contractors who have accumulated a specified number of 2Zs may be considered for a discretionary financial reward by the Company, based on their contributions to the Platform. This consideration is not a standard exchange and is unique to the contractor relationship within Free2Z.

## Revenue Calculation and Payout

- The determination of financial rewards for contractors is based on a range of factors, including the number of 2Zs associated with their platform contributions.
- The method of financial reward, initially envisaged as Zcash, is subject to the Company's discretion and may evolve in line with business needs and regulatory compliance.

## Compliance and Verification

- Financial reward considerations for contractors are conducted with due diligence, including necessary compliance checks in line with Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) regulations. These checks are specific to the contractor relationship and are not indicative of financial transaction services.

## Changes to Policy

- The Company may update this Policy at any time. Continued participation in the revenue share program signifies acceptance of the new terms.

## Governing Law

- This Policy is governed by the laws of the Country where the Company is established.

## Contact Information

By participating in the Revenue Share Program and redeeming 2Zs on Free2Z, you acknowledge and agree to be bound by this Token Redemption Policy.
