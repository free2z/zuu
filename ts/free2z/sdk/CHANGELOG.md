# Changelog

## 0.1.0 — unreleased

Initial TypeScript facade, browser OAuth/Fetch transport, native pull bridge,
lossless integer decoding, purchase polling, and structured settlement recovery.

- `ChatRequest.response_format` (`ResponseFormat`): opt-in structured output,
  `json_schema` (`name`, `schema`, `strict?`) or `json_object`. Checked locally
  against the gateway's limits and rebuilt member by member before sending;
  absent is never sent. The native transport passes the schema as plain JSON.
- `ChatRequest.max_output_tokens_strict` (free2z/zuu#1122): opt in to a refusal
  before any hold or charge instead of a gateway-lowered output limit. Sent only
  when `true`; requires `max_output_tokens`.
- `SignInOptions.spendCap` (`SpendCapHint`, `CapPeriod`): an optional, additive
  suggested spend cap sent as `f2z_spend_cap` / `f2z_spend_period`.
  Only pre-selects the consent screen; read the result from
  `grant()`.
