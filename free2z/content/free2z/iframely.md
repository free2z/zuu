# Iframely

Iframely has created a great service that can allow embeds from 
[over 1900 domains](https://iframely.com/domains). 
But, it's not free; and, it almost certainly doesn't have
great privacy characteristics
with so many requests to 3rd parties flying around,
running javascript on the client ...

Still, Iframely is so pretty and so easy to implement
and so powerful that I've decided to add the capability
to free2z and see how it goes.

Some examples of what you can do with it
on free2z. Basically you just add

```md
::iframe[ANY URL YOU WANT]
```

## 500px.com

You can use virtually any image site.
For example, a sweet picture from
Lieven Maris on 500px.com:

```md
::iframe[https://500px.com/photo/1045730600/Longtailed-tit-by-Lieven-Maris?ctx_page=1&from=popular]
```

::iframe[https://500px.com/photo/1045730600/Longtailed-tit-by-Lieven-Maris?ctx_page=1&from=popular]


---------
## Google Maps

If you want to advertise a location
for an event or a business, for example,
you could use use Google Maps or
probably any other popular map provider

```md
::iframe[https://www.google.com/maps/place/Smithsonian+National+Museum+of+American+History/@38.8914829,-77.0308172,18z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x89b7b798ecb5b2c7:0x32b2170679e71dea!8m2!3d38.8912793!4d-77.0300509]
```

## Beatport

You can embed arbitrary rich content like your homie's beatport.

::embed[https://www.beatport.com/track/sams-graduation-day/16081916]

## iNaturalist

What can you not do?

You can embed iNaturalist observations to tell
a rich story:

```md
::iframe[https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/109113138]
```

::iframe[https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/109113138]


## Dropbox

Dropbox embeds are sweet.

```

## Conclusion

> Edit/Update: Iframely is the bomb and I bought it and love it!
> Great on privacy!

Iframely is not free and would create
intrinsic privacy snafus.
BUT, man if that's not cool.
That looks like the internet I want to
contribute to ...
When I started this `iframe.ly` experiment,
I wasn't altogether optimistic
that it would result in something that I was
enthusiastic about, that I
wanted to pay iframe.ly to embed 3rd party
content.
Maybe I'm not a huge fan of the adverby
`.ly` domain names.
Primarily, I'm just looking for simple ways
to share images, videos and sounds for myself
conveniently, safely and cheaply.
Anyways, iframe.ly is a really cool product.
I'll let the experiment continue.
If people like it, I will consider making
this integration permanent.
