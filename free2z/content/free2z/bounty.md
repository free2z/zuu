## Privacy, security, malware

Free2z should always score extremely high for privacy and perfect for malware when assessed by 3rd parties [like sucuri](https://sitecheck.sucuri.net/results/free2z.com).

### Privacy

Some things provided by 3rd parties are not very good for privacy - like a [3rd party oembed from Twitter or YouTube](https://free2z.cash/embeds). So, we may get dinged for that a little bit. I can guarantee you that free2z itself has no ads, no tracking, no cookie beyond the basic session for logging in.

### Security and Malware

I believe firmly that there is arbitrarily small $\epsilon$ possibility for there ever to be any malware on this site. I use industrial-strength sanitized rendering of the user-generated content, there are no uploads and I tightly control the build/deploy/infrastructure myself using a free and open source software stack that is the best-of-the-best. If there ever is malware, it would be because a library I rely on has a bad bug or I got completely pwnd by malicious hackers. I think the probability of that is small.

Any scan from any 3rd party should always look like this:

Or like this:

If you find a real instance of malware that could affect users of free2z (with hard evidence), I will send you 3 Zcash. For other useful heads up, I will send you some Zcash based on how much I feel the contribution was worth :).
