Zcash Community Grants (ZCG) is electing a new member! As a member of Zcash Community Advisory Panel (ZCAP), I get to officially vote for who I approve of. I approve of everyone. So, having a hard time not just "voting" for everyone!.

Maybe I have a favorite or two though and should just "approve" them and not the other candidates who I also really like?

Anyways, I thought it would be fun to do a z2z poll on free2z to see what the community thinks!

Get to know the candidates in a one-hour discussion:

Also, checkout their forum posts below.

You can vote as many times as you want and weight your votes with the amount of Zcash you send. The default is 0.00000001 ZEC! If you feel strongly about one particular candidate, feel free to send more to show your support.

All proceeds will go into the free2z hot wallet and will be sent out to the community.
