## History


I started to work on this site a couple of weeks ago and just needed a logo as a placeholder. So, I spent 5 minutes defacing the official Zcash logo with my touchpad and went on building the site. Well, that's still the logo we have today a couple of weeks later.

## The Feel of the Logo

There are a couple of things that I want to suggest with the logo.

* Irreverent and festive, confetti, fiesta, hot pink
  * Latin American Graffiti Party
* A petri-dish with a Z-shaped treatment applied

I like the current logo OK. But, I'm not a great visual artist by any means. I'm willing to pay a Zcash to get a really kick-ass professional logo with transparent edges that looks nice on black and white.

If you or anyone you know is up for the challenge, ping me via private memo, comments here or on Twitter.

Thanks!
