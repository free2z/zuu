## One Zcash to the best page by March 15th

When I announced I was going to give away 1 Zec to the best page on free2z, I expected 10 days might be enough to get 100s or even 1000s of pages created. But, in this scam-filled world, it takes time to build trust. Only a handful of bonafide pages have been created so far by anyone but me and my friends. One Creator and new friend stood out:

Yoditar captured in his writing some of the true spirit of free2z.
He provided timely feedback in the very first few days of the site being live
when feedback was most at a premium. He has also helped with quality assurance, security, social media, trolls and general moral support.
I know that giving Yoditar the 1 Zcash prize will help to expand the Zcash and free2z communities. In my opinion, expanding adoption of Zcash is one of the most important things that we can do right now to work towards human rights and freedom for everyone on the planet. With this in mind,
I'm pleased to honor my original pledge to donate 1 Zcash to the best page on free2z by March $15^{th}$. Congratulations Yoditar!

Check out some of the other pages I'm also grateful to have on the site:

## But what about Sunday?

I got a little wishy-washy and extended the deadline to Sunday for the first F2Z giveaway. Perhaps I will give away another Zcash on Sunday. I see people making their pages more awesome as we speak. In the future, as the site takes off, I'd like to do something a bit more formal for monthly, weekly and even daily awards with
open, transparent criteria.
Right now I'm honestly just improvising to find things that work and doing whatever
I want to do! The above creators will find small tokens of my appreciation in
their wallets for taking the plunge and becoming early adopters in this little experiment. Thank you to everyone who has created a page on F2Z.
I look forward to seeing all the cool content in the future!
