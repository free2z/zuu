## Embedding content

You can now really easily embed content from [over 200 providers](https://oembed.com/providers.json) with special markdown syntax. To add a youtube video to your zPage it looks like this:

```md
::embed[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0gI9F876iY]
```

This results in:

::embed[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0gI9F876iY]

Let's see if we can do a tweet:

```md
::embed[https://twitter.com/free2zcash/status/1503586727717396482]
```

::embed[https://twitter.com/free2zcash/status/1503586727717396482]

Holy cow! That's pretty sick! But what about maybe soundcloud?

```md

```

I took away some HTML features to be more secure. But, you don't want to be fiddling with that anyways. This is much easier. Photos, videos you name it. What else can we do?
