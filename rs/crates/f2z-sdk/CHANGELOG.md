# Changelog

## 0.1.0 — unreleased

Initial reviewed SDK contract implementation. Publication is disabled pending
release acceptance; see the repository SDK release guide.

- Tool `parameters` and the `response_format` schema are
  `f2z_ai_proto::OrderedJson` (free2z/zuu#1132): sent in the order written.
  `serde_json::json!(…).into()` still compiles but is already sorted; parse
  the schema text to keep its order.
- `ChatRequest::response_format` (via `f2z_ai_proto`): opt-in structured
  output, `ResponseFormat::JsonSchema { json_schema: JsonSchemaFormat { name,
  schema, strict } }` or `ResponseFormat::JsonObject {}`; `ResponseFormat::check`
  applies the gateway's limits locally. `Capabilities::structured_output`
  reports `/v1/models` support.

- `SignInOptions::spend_cap` / `with_spend_cap(SpendCapHint)` and `CapPeriod`:
  an optional, additive suggested spend cap sent as `f2z_spend_cap` /
  `f2z_spend_period`. Only pre-selects the consent screen.
