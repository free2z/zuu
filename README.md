# The ZUU

The 2Z monorepo.

## What is it?

The ZUU is a collection of modules, applications, experiments,
documentation, guides and tools for working within the 2Z UX ecosystem.

The ZUU is a metarepo which creates a synthetic trunk for integrating
different modules within the wider Zero-Knowledge universe.

### Zcash submodules

  in the repo: Rust, Go, npm, Python3, etc
* `docs/` - Documentation, GUIDES and notes
* `ex/` - Experiments and examples
* `private/` - .gitignored for convenience
* `z/` - Submodules in `{GITHUB_USER}/{GITHUB_REPO}` format
